      "Text: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (stylized in marketing as Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3) is a 2023 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy, produced by Marvel Studios, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe SaldaÃ±a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the Guardians must save Rocket's (Cooper) life and protect him from the High Evolutionary (Iwuji).\n",
      "Gunn stated in November 2014 that he had initial ideas for a third and final film in the series, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017. Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn's return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on The Suicide Squad (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series Peacemaker (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\n",
      "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success. Many deemed the film as a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023.\n",

After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula, and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are useless at healing Rocket's wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by the High Evolutionary, Rocket's creator. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.\n",
      "As Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. He was found as a baby raccoon and was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence and used his insight to fix a defect in later Humanimal batches, but planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket fled in a spaceship.\n",
      "In the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora, help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the ArÃªte Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket, while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to ArÃªte. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as she is armed; Quill and Groot enter ArÃªte, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group.\n",

In the film, Quill is in a \"state of depression\" following the appearance of a variant of his dead lover Gamora, who does not share the same affection for Quill as her older version had for him, which in turn affects his leadership of the Guardians.\\nZoe SaldaÃ±a as Gamora:An orphan who seeks redemption for her past crimes, and was adopted and trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin. The original version of Gamora, a member of the Guardians, was killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and an alternate version of the character traveled to the present in Avengers: Endgame (2019); SaldaÃ±a reprises the latter role in this film, now serving as a member of the Ravagers. SaldaÃ±a stated that Vol. 3 would be the final time she would portray Gamora, noting that she originally signed to play her in one film and ended up playing the role for much longer, a role she was grateful to play due to the impact it especially had on female fans.\\nDave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:A member of the Guardians and a highly skilled warrior whose family was slaughtered by Ronan the Accuser, under the instructions of Thanos. Bautista stated that Vol. 3 would be the final time he would portray Drax, having been grateful for the role, while still calling it a \"relief\" to have concluded his time with the character, given the long hours needed to get into makeup and hoping to pursue more dramatic acting roles.', start_char_idx=5836, end_char_idx=7958, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1000.0),\n",

The other Guardians stage a rescue, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary\\'s forces. Kraglin fires on ArÃªte with Knowhere, dooming ArÃªte, then helps to save Knowhere\\'s citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary\\'s Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary\\'s crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill\\'s group. The Guardians delay leaving ArÃªte, choosing to rescue the children created by the High Evolutionary, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo\\'s telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary, and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over, but is saved by Adam, who was saved from ArÃªte by Groot as \"everyone deserves a second chance\".\\nIn the end, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as captain, and travels to Earth to reunite with Jason, his grandfather. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.\\nIn a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam\\'s pet Blurp, take on a new mission. \\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\nChris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:The half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers, the Ravagers.', start_char_idx=4486, end_char_idx=6541, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1000.0),\n",

Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill's group. The Guardians delay leaving ArÃªte, choosing to rescue the children created by the High Evolutionary, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary, and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere.
